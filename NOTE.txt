12. API Fetching - axios
        Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). 
        On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
        Features:
           -> Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
           -> Make http requests from node.js
           -> Supports the Promise API
           -> Intercept request and response
           -> Transform request and response data
           -> Cancel requests
        Install
            ->npm install axios
        useEffect
        The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in your Components.

            -> React Router Dom  -    npm i react-router-dom

            -> Browser Router ->   Used to setup app routing
            -> Routes ->    To hold more than one Route (Used to hold multiple Components)
            -> Route -> Used to setup a Component Path

        -> useParams() - React hook
        In our React app sometimes we want to access the parameters of the current route in this case useParams hook comes into action. The react-router-dom package has useParams hooks that let you access the parameters of the current route.
